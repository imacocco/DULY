DADApy is a Python package for the characterisation of manifolds in high dimensional spaces.

# Quick Example

```python
import numpy as np
from dadapy.data import Data

# a simple 3D gaussian dataset
X = np.random.normal(0, 1, (1000, 3))

# initialise the "Data" class with a
# set of coordinates
data = Data(X)

# compute distances up to the 100th
# nearest neighbour
data.compute_distances(maxk = 100)

# compute the intrinsic dimension
data.compute_id_2NN()

# compute the density of all points using a basic kNN estimator
data.compute_density_kNN(k = 15)

# or using a more advanced PAk estimator
data.compute_density_PAk()

# find the peaks of the density profile
data.compute_clustering()
```

# Installation
The package is compatible with Python >= 3.6 (tested on 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9). We currently only support Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS. 
For Windows-machines we suggest using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).
The exact list of dependencies are given in setup.py and all of them will be automatically installed during setup.

The package contains Cython-generated C extensions that are automatically compiled during install. 

The latest stable release is (not yet!) available through pip: (add the `--user` flag if root access is not available

```sh
pip install dadapy
```

To install the latest development version, clone the source code from github
and install with pip from local file:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sissa-data-science/DADApy.git
cd DADApy
pip install .
```
